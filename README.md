# basketballscraper
program to scrape basketball team data off of the wayback machine and the NCAA website
The first program, currentbbalstats, just scrapes the NCAA website as is, getting the current stats that day. 
It outputs this information into a CSV, titled 'D1 Mens Basketball (today's date).csv'
